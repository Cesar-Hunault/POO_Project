# Software for managing a fictitious X-ray center

Implementation of a software that allows practitioners to efficiently manage patient files and assist in follow-up and diagnosis.

This software fulfills all the requested specifications, i.e. adding, deleting, displaying the characteristics of the examinations by patient, by date, by examination number, as well as the possibility of loading/saving the list of X-rays from/to a file.

The whole implementation is functional for the version running in a terminal (src_sans_interface directory). A graphical version is implemented with gtkmm but is still incomplete.
